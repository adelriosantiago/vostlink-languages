	'long_description' => "Every image we see, every figure we look at has an equivalent in sound.
		Figures with sharp corners will sound more aggresively than softer things like clouds.
		Take a look at this video that shows how pictures sound:
		<br/>
		<div class='text-center'>
			<iframe width='420' height='315' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/8BGr1u-Oz8M' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
		</div>
		<br/>
		This program will do a similar process with in a different approach, it will interpret images as a whole and produce a single
		continuous sound so that the blind person will be able to immediatly hear a sound for every video frame that the webcam captures.
		<br/>		
		<br/>		
		Here is a real sample of how it would work, right now it is done the hard way, by doing each step manually.
		The program Sight-sound will automate this process in single device. Here are 2 sample images,
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<div class='row'>
			<div class='large-6 columns'>
				<a href='/img/night.jpg' data-lightbox='sketches' title='Night city image.'>
					<img class='rounded-image' src='/img/night.jpg'/>
				</a>
			</div>
			<div class='large-6 columns'>
				<div class=''>
					<a href='/img/clouds.jpg' data-lightbox='sketches' title='Cloud landscape.'>
						<img class='rounded-image' src='/img/clouds.jpg'/>
					</a>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br/>
		When we convert bot images to its Fourier equivalent we get the following images,
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<div class='row'>
			<div class='large-6 columns'>
				<a href='/img/night-fft.jpg' data-lightbox='sketches' title='Night city image in fourier.'>
					<img class='rounded-image' src='/img/night-fft.jpg'/>
				</a>
			</div>
			<div class='large-6 columns'>
				<div class=''>
					<a href='/img/clouds-fft.jpg' data-lightbox='sketches' title='Cloud landscape in fourier.'>
						<img class='rounded-image' src='/img/clouds-fft.jpg'/>
					</a>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br/>
		The images in Fourier are actually telling the shape of the image in a very peculiar way. Both images contain blank dots at the center of it, these are the \"soft objects\" objects, if the image contains \"fine objects\" then blank dots will start appearing far from the center of he image.
		That's why the night city landscape image has blank dots that are far from the center, those diagonal shapes we see on the fourier are in fact the building covered with blank lines of reflectors.
